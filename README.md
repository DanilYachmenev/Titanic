This is a tutorial kernel for those who are trying themselves in this famous competition.
Original datasets can be found on the competition website.

Also here is my [kernel on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/danilyachmenev13/how-to-think-about-data-for-newbies-0-80-0-83).

In order to reuse my code on your environment, copypaste my code, download required datasets from the competiton webpage and replace the paths to them on your pc.

Hope it will be helpful for you and good luck!
